Hough Transform:
Hough transform is a popular technique to detect any shape, if you can represent that shape in a mathematical form.
It can detect the shape even if it is broken or distorted a little bit.

Hough transform algorithm involves four steps:
1. Edge detection using canny edge detctor
2. Mapping the edge points to the Hough space and storage in accumulator.
3.Interpretation of the accumulator to yield lines of infinite length. The Interpretation is done by thresholding and 
  other possible constraints
4.Conversion of infinite lines to finite lines.
